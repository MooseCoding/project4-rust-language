This is my fourth project for the summer of making by hackclub.

We're gonna do a programming language written in Rust. I've done this priorly in some Rust and some C but never fully so lets try it today :)

# Things to add

- [x] Function definitions & usage
- [x] Adding/subtracting
- [x] If statements
- [x] While loops
- [x] For loops
- [x] Boolean Logic
- [x] Libraries 
- [x] Arrays
- [x] Breaking
- [x] Comments
- [x] Example code for every feature 
- [x] Classes
- [ ] Nodes for servers/client interaction 
- [ ] Database Support 
- [ ] Advanced Arrays (returning and more)
- [x] Power (^) symbol
- [ ] Errors/Error handling 
- [ ] Debug Tools
- [ ] Documentation 
- [x] Constructors
- [x] Returning classes 
- [ ] Library classes
- [ ] String/Array dot commands

The final goal, once all prior features are done is to add a compiler

# Installation 

Make sure that you have rust and cargo installed, download or clone the project into a folder:

On a unix system to run as an interpreter run 
```bash 
cargo run -- ./{file}.iron 
```
