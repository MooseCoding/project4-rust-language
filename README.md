This is my fourth project for the summer of making by hackclub.

We're gonna do a programming language written in Rust. I've done this priorlyin some Rust and some C but never fully so lets try it today :)

Things to add

- [x] Function definitions & usage
- [x] Adding/subtracting
- [x] If statements
- [x] While loops
- [x] For loops
- [ ] Classes
- [ ] Boolean Logic
- [ ] Libraries (std, std::math, std::time. std::string)
- [ ] Arrays

I was going to do more, but the current structure is kinda cooked so I'll add the rest to my next programming language (which I'll write in C).
