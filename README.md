This is my fourth project for the summer of making by hackclub.

We're gonna do a programming language written in Rust. I've done this priorlyin some Rust and some C but never fully so lets try it today :)

Things to add

- [x] Function definitions & usage
- [x] Adding/subtracting
- [ ]

I was going to do more, but the current structure is kinda cooked so I'll add the rest to my next programming language (which I'll write in C).
